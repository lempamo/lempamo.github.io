My break from #1GAM is _over_!

And I've made a spoof of Zork. You know where to look!

Also, I have a YouTube channel where I work with marbles and other stuff.
I may even post game demos! Channel is here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmfQP-XVBT5JesKbCJ7uNuQ

See you later!

P.S. hi robin johnson
