So hello there.

I have been busy working hard on things.
For example, I made two Algodoo series on my YouTube channel.

And, I'm working on an alchemy game. You may have already seen some previews if you looked at the source code.

Anyways, I gotta get back to it. 

See ya!

P.S.: If you're interested in helping out with a Java program, tweet me @lempamo.
