Hey guys!

It's been a while, I know. But I got a new game to show you!

It's called "Sokoban + Story" and it's just what it sounds like.

It's my #1GAM entry for November and November's theme: "Prose".

You can find it up above.

Also, I want to thank Jupiter Hadley for trying out my game. It means a lot.

See you next time!
